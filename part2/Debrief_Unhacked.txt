1. Brendan McDonnell, Anthony Romero, and Cameron Vollrath for CSCI341 Midterm Part 2: Unhacked on 10/06/2020
2. Spent about 90 minutes on it. 
3. Python to clean up the visual clutter, identifying and removing red herrings,  cleaning up the visual clutter, and then reading the control flow.
4. Didn't need help.
5. Nothing needed improvement since it was straightforward.
6. We think it was successful becuase the code we recieved was relatively simple and the result makes sense relative to the "unhacked" code.
